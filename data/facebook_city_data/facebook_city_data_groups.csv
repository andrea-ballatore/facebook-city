I've had so many try to claim this dog I found. And when asked questions they seem to lose interest... Dog fighting is on a rise and our beloved bull breed is in danger. Our lost dogs could end up in the wrong hands and used as bait!! LETS STAND TOGETHER!! Let's get these babies home!!!

The group is for all of us here in Bromley and surrounding area who may be holding onto things we no longer need, but don't want to sell, but cannot bring ourselves to throw away.	If you GIVE away something you don‚Äôt want, or re-use other people‚Äôs items, you‚Äôre helping to reduce the waste in the world, and giving a new lease of life to an object that otherwise would be in a landfill.	If you NEED something, make this your first port of call - help re-use someone else's unwanted item rather than buying something brand new and contributing to the creation of more unnecessary products in the world.	'One man's trash is another man's treasure' and all that sort of thing.	GUIDELINES 	1. If you have something to GIVE write that at the top of your post along with a description, and ideally a photo, of what you're giving and your area. When it is gone remove the post. If you need or want something just start your message with NEED;	2. No offering or asking for animals; they are not ""stuff"".	3. For found IDs and credit cards, use lost and found services and NEVER post anyone's photo or information (credit card, ID, passport, etc.) on facebook without their consent;	4. Speciesist, like racist, sexist, discriminating or aggressive posts against anyone will not be tolerated and will be removed by the admins;	5. If you are not sure about a person, profile, or if someone is harassing you via PM, please get in touch with an admin;	6. Don't publish your e-mail address here;	7. The group, although present in many cities, is not an institution nor organization and all admins are helping out on an anti-profit basis without any financial, or other, benefit;	8. If you see another member ask for an item you want yourself, please don't use this member's post. The person took the time to create a post and you are basically surfing their post. Create a new one to ask for a similar item.	Making contact:	When requesting an offered item, ONLY DO so via the post, DO NOT PM people to ask for an item. PM is only to arrange pick up once the request for an item has been agreed.  Note that people who are not friends on Facebook will not always be able to contact each other via PM and that between non-friends, messages will often be dropped into a folder named ""others"" which you can find on your message board.	Who gets what?	This decision belongs to the person who gives it away. Make sure the person you are giving to actually has a good plan for how to come and pick up the stuff. Feel free to give your stuff to whoever can come first to pick up the stuff but, in fact, you can choose the one you like, whatever your reasons are. Nobody has to explain oneself why s/he gives or needs something.	Have fun, and help save the planet!

I am happy for local business to advertise on here but It is not for mail order companies, pyramid sellers, I can make you a million sellers etc etc 	Rules of the site	First off, if you are interested in something for sale, please state a clear 'yes I would like/ yes I am interested'. Just asking a question does not mean you necessarily want the item and does not mean you are first in line.	Then if you do place an interest please follow it up, do not leave it for hours without any contact. Or again clearly state that you are working etc and will get back to the buyer by end of day. I do not expect buyers to hang on and hang on if there is other interest.	Definitely NO gazumping. Do not go above someone else's offer. This underhand and not how this site works.	If a buyer requests you contact them by phone then please do so, not everyone uses messenger.	When you have arranged to collect an item, please please do so. If there is any reason you cannot collect then please contact the seller immediately. Nobody wants to wait In or leave items out for a length of period. 	There will be a zero tolerance now on buyers that do not collect, unless obviously there is a good valid reason.  This group is getting too big so I will only now allow genuine, honest local people.	Please do not take something for free or buy something with the ultimate intention of re selling on this site. I will not allow people to make money out of other people's kindness üòÄ	One last thing, when you go to collect an item. Please make sure you check it before leaving, for any damage etc. There can be no comeback once the item is in your hands.	Replica items allowed. BUT must be clearly stated on listing. Do not sell fake goods claiming they are real - you will be removed !	No selling of ANY type of animals please.	Returns are not allowed. All items are sold as seen. Electrical items should be checked and tested on purchase. Items are bought at buyers risk.	Admin is allowed to remove your post should they disagree with what you are selling. üòÄ	No foul language.

You may even find it easier to write a post LISTING all of the items that you are selling and when a buyer enquires or asks for a picture you can post this as a comment. 	3) Bump once every 24 hours only, if bumping more than 4 then make sure you bump the album and not individual pictures	4) no excessive reposting. i understand that sometimes its hard to find your post if there have been lots of posts already, BUT you can use the search function if on a computer/laptop/tablet to find your posts and bump them. If using a phone then i suggest attempted to find your post or asking admin to find and bump the post. Failing that you can repost as long as it is a one off. 	5) NO ADVERTISING AT ALL AND SPAMMERS and posts that are related to utilities, mobile phones, loans, weight loss and other companies trying to get people to sign up, work for them or to boost someones business  and other such like companies will be immediately deleted and banned permanently from the group. Admin will regularly look through to find anyone posting items like these. 	6) Please try to add location and price to all posts, i do understand if uploading an album that this can be time consuming so this will not be monitored but it makes it easier for the other members. 	7) Be Courteous, polite and friendly. Any aggressive behavior or threatening posts will be reported and users will be banned permanently. 	IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ADD OOS (on other sites) TO YOUR POST IF YOU ARE POSTING IN VARIOUS GROUPS OR PLACES AS THIS WILL STOP ANY MOANING FROM BUYERS WHO MISS OUT ON THE ITEM WHEN YOU TELL THEM IT IS SOLD.

ALL posts should include photo, price & size and area. 	PLEASE PUT SOLD SO WE CAN REMOVE POST ASWELL THANK YOU. Do not private message an offer, comment on the original post to keep it fair. Do not use slang such as 'int' and then wonder why you have not been given first refusal. anything with a link will be removed due to previous problems And this is not a site for people to sell items from catalogues  Pictures are to be actual ones not from catalogues,  So play nicely no badgering a potential buyer/seller. If any of the above are broken Admin will delete and block you, as we do not need the extra work.  :) 	See less	Private	Only members can see who's in the group and what they post.

Ridley Road traders have a good reputation and have nothing to hide from the agencies. 	BUT, after being closely scrutinised day in, day out by those people, it became obvious that this was in fact a campaign of bullying and intimidation. The order to do this must have come from the local authorities. Some of the older, long standing traders found this too much to handle and gave up their licences, we suspect causing great glee to the council. After complaints by us, the enforcement eased slightly.	THEN the council turned to their second tactic; without warning they cut off our electricity supply in the middle of the winter, despite people telling us maintenance had been carried out only weeks before. They said they had written reports saying the electricity was dangerous. We asked to see the report but we have not seen any sign of it. We then asked the council for the safety certificate for our electricity supply which must be obtained by law, no sign of that either. Our point to the council being; Surely if you have paid a company to maintain the electricity supply, and weeks after it had been proved dangerous, you would get them back to correct their poor work as a matter of urgency, ASAP. The council‚Äôs response; NO RESPONSE.	We are now looking forward to a dark winter. The traders are convinced that the council will do all it can to run down Ridley Road market and do their upmost to sabotage it. Our informed opinion is that they would like to sell the site of our market, of nearly 200 stalls, to property developers with one eye on the 2012 Olympics.

LAST FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH	FROM 6.00pm, LEAVE AT 7:00pm 	SOUTH BANK, UNDER WATERLOO BRIDGE (by the British Film Institute).	WHO ARE WE AND WHAT ARE OUR AIMS?	We are not sure, opinions seem to differ. There are probably as many aims of CM as there are participants. Each individual comes there with his or her own idea of what it's about, and the sum of this makes up the Mass. We have no organisers and no planned routes.	The London monthly rides started in April 1994. It isn't just for cyclists, sometimes there are wheelchair users, skateboarders, roller bladers and skaters, and other self-propelled people. Cycle sound systems often accompany the ride, creating a colourful, party atmosphere that welcomes riders of all ages and abilities. It is a family-friendly event that relies on participants being considerate to each other and to other road users, even if we do hold their journey up for a couple of minutes. People who are unable to ride responsibly and safely should consider staying away.	POSTING GUIDELINES	Please keep posts (not comments in threads) relevant to Critical Mass (including legal and policy that may effect the ride) and cycling related content. This group does not exist to provide a marketing platform for products, businesses (even bike shops, although personal recommendations are welcome), non-cycling events or pages.	Off-topic and commercial posts will be removed, spammers and hate trolls will be banned. 	In keeping with CM's all-inclusive spirit please avoid posts and comments that may be considered sexist, homophobic, racist, ageist or against that spirit in any other way. These too will be removed. Although it's inevitable that debates will sometimes become heated, please remain respectful to each other, however much you disagree. Complaints about abuse can be made to admins. who will do their best to treat the matter fairly and rationally.

We are a network of individuals who hold a vision of a better more environmentally friendly Croydon. We are not a constituted group. 	We engage with politicians when we need to bring pressure to bear but we are not party politic. We support and encourage individual projects and initiatives and help new projects to get off the ground. 	We use this Facebook page as our main means of communication. 	Suggestions for more projects to improve our community come from people like yourself. This is in the spirit of ""Do-ocracy"".	There is no membership apart from membership of this FB Group.	We occasionally have real physical meetings which you may request and they are the best place to pitch new ideas. If you do pitch an idea then it will be suggested that you lead it forward.  	Meanwhile, taking part in one or other of the community gardening activities is the best way to get involved with the group on a practical and personal level.	This group is administered and any offensive  messages will be removed and repeat offenders maybe banned. 	Press Join to join the FB group.

I will reply to all emails/Inbox messages as quickly as I can but the best way to get on the bill is attend a Tuesday night as audience, stay and support the acts and the night and ask in person for a future spot! The night itself will consist of 15-17 pre-booked acts. Acts are requested to bring at least one audience member and expected to stay and support fellow comedians. The spots are 5 - 10 minutes long depending on comics experience and time allowances. 	See less	Public	Anyone can see who's in the group and what they post.	Visible	Anyone can find this group.

londonccc,https://en-gb.facebook.com/groups/londonccc,facebook_search_manual,immigrant groups,TRUE,,,,,,,,FALSE,Friends of the London Chinese Community Centre,"The London Chinese Community Centre aims to improve the quality of life and well being of the Chinese Community in Britain, particularly those who are disadvantaged.	We are located at 2 Leicester Court, by Leicester Square and right by London's Chinatown. We are currently closed due to coronavirus but provide a wide range of information, advice and training services plus social and community activities. 	The London Chinese Community Centre is open to all and you are welcome to drop in and visit us.	History of the London Chinese Community Centre	The London Chinese Community Centre was established in London's Chinatown in 1980. This was the first community facility for the Chinese Community in Britain, providing advocacy, social support, guidance and advice services. In its first year the Centre received almost 1,000 requests for support. This high level of demand, combined with the rapid establishment of similar centres in other areas of London and across the UK, confirmed the need for a community base and support services for the Chinese Community. Since then, the London Chinese Community Centre has been a focal point for London's Chinese community, providing an evolving range of community and social services.	In 1992 the London Chinese Community Centre moved to its current premises at 28/29 Gerrard Street on a 10 year lease. These larger premises have enabled the Centre to expand its range of activites as well as increasing the number of people who can use them.	Chinese people in the UK	The 2001 census identified a total Chinese population in the UK of 247,403. This represents 0.4% of the national population and 5.3% of the national ethnic minority population. Of the total Chinese population, 80,203 (about 36%) live in London. Almost half of London's Chinese population live in inner London, in comparison with less than 40% on London's total population. Almost 20% of London's Chinese population live in three London boroughs; Barnet, Southwark and Westminster.	The London Chinese Community Centre undertakes research into key issues for Chinese communities in the UK. 	For further information please visit our website: 	www.ccc.org.uk	A NOTE ABOUT POSTING ON THE FORUM	We are happy to act as bulletin board for the community provided the following rules are met	- All posts will be judged appropriate for the Chinese Community (at admin's discretion)	- We discourage advertising, business promotion posts	- Once posted we also discourage repeat posting of the same material, content or social groups within a 3 month period 	See less",Public,TRUE,2009,2009-02,2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"London, United Kingdom",General,2022-09-26,4818,0,0,1	No promotions or spam,0,medium,inactive,0,inactive,0_london,0_london,0,london

Once a part of this group, you are able to 1) advertise for a housemate or property 2) advertise a property you are looking to move out from.	This group is run by an Islamic Society, therefore we would kindly request that females advertise for female only housemates and males advertise for male only housemates. If we see otherwise, we WILL intervene. So please play by the rules :)	Please take caution when speaking to people and landlords, advertising and signing contracts. You are able to contact us for any further advice or guidance regarding this on our Kingston Isoc page. Alternatively, you can speak to a University member of staff in the student center on the bottom floor of the JG building.	Do not leave any personal information in your advertisement, especially phone numbers. If you would like to leave any means of contact, an email address would be more appropriate.

We only approve properties/wanted ads with an SE postcode! 	PLEASE READ OUR RULES AND GUIDELINES as all posts are subject to approval.	Your post can take up to a week to be approved. We DO NOT fast track requests so please stop messaging me asking me to approve yours over other people's. If your post passes then it will be approved, regardless of whether or not you message me.	Secondly, I do not accept friend requests! I find this to be extremely inappropriate and frustrating. Your messages always go to my other inbox because we are connected by the group. Adding me as a friend will not affect that.	We only have a few rules here and they are: 	Only posts to do with residential properties are permitted. Be aware that if you post anything other than this, such as commercial spaces (including art/design studios), items for sale or event promotion, you will be removed and blocked without warning. There are plenty of sales groups on Facebook and websites dedicated to this. Anyone who encourages these posts by commenting on them will be deleted but not blocked. Its not our intention to hinder anybody but this is a place for residential properties.	Strictly no air bnbs (this is where you get someone to stay in your place, pay your rent and hold your stuff while you are away).	There are two conditions for advertising sublets or short-term lets.	1) the let must be a period of 4 weeks/month or longer.	2a) the tenant will need to take over your contract until it ends.	OR	2b) if you intend to return after period of time, you may not have any of your stuff kept in the property that you are letting. E.g. You can't leave your books in the bedroom that you are subletting as this counts as an airbnb. 	No estate agents (though you may provide a link to a webpage that has photos/description of your property). Please be aware that if you look like you're an estate agent rather than a tenant your post may be subject to a review.	Under no circumstances may you advertise your student digs (accommodation provided by a university) to non-students or as a sublet. Uni accommodation may only be taken over by a student at that university and it must be for the REMAINDER of your contract. You put yourself and your tenant at risk by violating the terms of contract which will result in the removal of your tenant and you may be kicked out of uni. 	AS A COURTESY: Please remove your post once a property has gone or clearly indicate that you have reserved it for someone. Leaving up posts as if they are still available is very frustrating and hugely time wasting for other members.	NOTE: If you violate the above rules your post may be subject to immediate removal and you be banned from the group. The rules have been carefully revised thanks to our members and finalised by the page creator and admins.	There are guidelines for sellers and searchers which can be found in the pinned post.

There are relevant business pages and groups on facebook. However we encourage members to share experiences of local businesses and help others to shop local and support local business. 	This is not a Newham council page.	Forest Gate has a lot to offer and is an amazing community, so lets get networking.	Members can join who have a genuine connection with Forest Gate. If there is no connection evident on your public profile your membership request may be declined.	A few group rules:	- treat everyone with respect. You can disagree but please no insults	- Racist, sexist posts, homophobic or hate speech not welcome and such posts and comments will be deleted.	- Please tag admins if you need to report anything as well as report to Facebook.	- No direct selling posts and no recycle 	goods adverts allowed. Please use alternative local Sell and Swap groups on fb which are fantastic for this. 	 (recommendations are okay). There are loads of other facebook local selling groups out there.	- No spamming	- Repeat offenders will be removed and blocked by administration	---------------- 	See less",Private,TRUE,2015,2015-07,2015-07-26T00:00:00Z,no place,General,2022-09-26,3416,188,7,1	No hate speech or bullying	2	No promotions or spam	3	Respect everyone's privacy	4	Be kind and courteous,0.055,medium,medium,55.0351288056206,high,suburb,3_suburb,3,suburb

In line with other similar groups to this, when it comes to selling your personal stuff, please post multiple items into an album instead of posting several times. To avoid the page being clogged I'd appreciate it too if you could delete posts once items have been sold. Please also limit your sales posts to once a week - there are plenty of other local sites to sell through, and it would be appreciated if you could make the most of these as well as Kew Friends. 	Likewise, please limit business advertising posts to one per month if generic / services / product based unless you have something new and different to say.	Lively debates on local issues are definitely encouraged, however please can we always ensure that it remains friendly and polite.

We want to share our memories of this wonderful place and perhaps find out about your memories.  Back in postwar Britain there weren't many luxuries, but people certainly had wonderful experiences that no TV or movie could replace.  We didn't need toys, because we had the streets to play  (There were so few cars before the mid 60's) and some had the bombed ruins ...the old St. Faith's Church at Knebworth Road was a big playground for some.  The only thing left of the church were three walls which the older kids walked very carefully around: many a child ended up with broken arms or legs.  There were many sweet shops in the area but Pagliaro's sweet shop in Neville Road brought kids from afar especially when once a year he would make children ice lollies. Kids would queue up patiently outside the shop and wait for him to appear.  It was actually lemonade on a stick with bits of real Lemons in it.  Yummie!   Many loved Pagliaro and the rest of the local shops, many of which you will find discussed on the group and a photo or two in the photo albums. We have over 200 albums and about 200 documents with the history of places and people from around Stoke Newington and the surrounding areas including Hackney, Dalston, Shoreditch, Hoxton, Newington Green and Dalston.

A community where you can share events, place notices, advertise, ask advice, give tips, plan meet ups, make local business recommendations, social events etc. Please feel free to add anyone you think it's relevant for and spread the word. 	As with other groups, please use common sense when posting personal comments.	Thanks Amelia	PAF Founder	Additional notes:	For Pitshanger and the surrounding areas eg Argyle Road, Brenthams, Castlebar Road, Hanger Hill, Montpelier, Mount Park, Perivale, St Stephen's, etc. Posts should relate to these localities.	This is not purely a selling group.  For personal sales: Prices *must* be given (face value or below for tickets). NB the sale of cigarettes and alcohol is not permitted.	If you want to sell more than one thing at a time, please only make one post and use the album feature for any photographs.  Please do not bump with comments or re-advertise items if they do not sell: you may consider re-pricing or using a different group.  See below for some local groups which are more sales-oriented.	Landlords: please state rent for any properties you advertise on the group.	We welcome posts from local businesses, especially but not exclusively those based in Pitshanger and surrounding areas.  However we ask you please to limit these to no more than a couple of times a month. Bumping of business ads is also discouraged.	Job ads are welcome, but the name and nature of the business must be given, along with some idea of what the job involves.  Ads which do not include this information will be deleted.	'Name and shame' posts about businesses are not appropriate for this group.  Taking up any issues with the businesses concerned is more likely to get a positive result than posting on Facebook in any case.	Details of disputes between individuals / organisations are also not appropriate for this group.  Posts containing photos of individuals and/or their property taken or posted without their permission will be removed, even if it appears that they have done something wrong.	This group is for members only (""closed""), so please do not copy posts out of it to other groups, or to other social media platforms such as Nextdoor or Twitter, without the permission of the person who made the original post. If you are found to have copied posts without this permission, you will be blocked from this group.	The sale of animals is not allowed in this group, as the admins cannot check the credentials of buyers or sellers.

St Matthias Old Church is located on Poplar High Street, opposite Tower Hamlets College. It is next to Poplar Town Hall - which has mosaic detail - and Poplar Bowls Club, which is part of Poplar Recreation Ground. A recently re-opened sports centre called The Workhouse stands on the site of Poplar Workhouse, where local politician Will Crooks spent some of his earliest years (a nearby council housing estate is named after him).	On 13 June 1917, German Gotha G bombers carried out the deadliest German raid on London during World War I. One of the bombs fell on a nursery school in Poplar, causing the death of forty-six children - a tragedy which shocked the British public at the time.[1]	The Metropolitan Borough of Poplar was the location, in 1921, of the Poplar Rates Rebellion, led by George Lansbury. As part of the 1951 Festival of Britain, a new council housing estate was built to the north of the East India Dock Road and named the Lansbury Estate after George Lansbury, Labour MP and former mayor of Poplar. This estate includes Chrisp Street Market, which was greatly commended by Lewis Mumford. The same era also saw the construction of the Robin Hood Gardens housing complex (overlooking the northern portal of the Blackwall Tunnel) - designed by architects Peter and Alison Smithson - and the similarly Modernist Balfron Tower, Carradale House and Glenkerry House (to the north) - designed by Ern≈ë Goldfinger. Other notable buildings in Poplar include Poplar Baths, finally closed in 1988, which local campaigners hope to get redeveloped.	In 1998, following ballots of the residents, Tower Hamlets Council transferred parts of the Lansbury estate and six other Council housing estates within Poplar to Poplar HARCA, a new Registered Social Landlord set up for the purpose of regenerating the area. The following year, tenants on further estates voted to remain with the Council. However, after a lengthy consultation of all Council estates in Tower Hamlets begun in 2002, most estates in Poplar did transfer to Poplar HARCA, East End Homes and other landlords between 2005 and 2007.	[edit]Poplar and London's docks	Footbridge at Aspen Way	Poplar also contains a Seamen's Mission, reflecting the area's long-standing connection to London's docks which for so many years gave the area employment. The original mission stood on Hale Street, but the current mission stands on the north side of East India Dock Road. Having fallen out of favour as a Mission, the building became the local headquarters of the Gas Board (testament to which is the gas fired streetlights to the rear of the property); it then became a Working men's club before it was finally converted into executive apartments.

The founder members had two main objectives: to ensure that the two thousand years of Willesden's history was not lost when the then new administrative Borough of Brent was born, and to seek out and record historical facts, because a community's future health is enhanced by a good knowledge of its past.	Now, the Society has members of all types, active researchers, family historians, authors, photographers, and some who just enjoy the lectures and fellowship at the meetings. All are welcome.	We are looking for people to become more involved in the running of the Society. Please come along and have a chat with us if you have an interest in local history and would like to help with the Society.	WLHS meets monthly from September to June, when lectures, usually with a Willesden flavour, are presented. A Journal is produced regularly, and from time to time there are guided walks and outings to places of historic interest. The Annual Subscription (¬£15.00) includes entry to all meetings and free copies of the WLHS Journal.

Group rules:	1) Racist, homophobic, misogynistic or hate speech of any kind is strictly forbidden. No bad language. No flaming, trolling or attacking other members. Transgressors will be blocked immediately.	2) Political or religious messages are strictly forbidden. Transgressors will be blocked immediately. Exceptions to this rule are when a member is discussing the political or religious history of the area.	3) Commercial posts advertising services or goods, whether local or not, are strictly forbidden. Transgressors will have their advertisement removed and they may be blocked permanently from the group. Exceptions to this rule are if a member is promoting something directly related to the history of East Twickenham and St Margarets, e.g. if they have written or published an article or book about local history, are promoting a local history event, e.g. a talk for a local history society or an open day at say, Turner's house. Check with the admins first if you are unsure.	4) Please try to stay focused on the local area. East Twickenham and St Margarets is roughly defined by the following boundaries: Railshead in Isleworth (i.e. the northern end of St Margarets Road) to the north, Richmond Bridge, Denton Road and Haversham Close to the east, the riverside between Meadowbank and Marble Hill Park to the south and the River Crane to the west (also Sion Road). These definitions are open to interpretation, let common sense prevail.	5) Please give accreditation to photos, prints, pictures and other peoples' research. Old prints, antique photographs and postcards are probably out of copyright, but give as much info as possible, e.g. 'From a postcard found on eBay, published by Valentines, date unknown'. Under no circumstances post modern photographs or artwork without the copyright holder's permission. Posting of Ordnance Survey maps without permission for example could get the group permanently shut down. If the image or research is your own, please clearly state that in the post.	6) Please try to steer clear of posting new topics like 'Does anyone remember Joan from Sidney Road who was married to Stan in the early 1950s?' These sort of posts clog up members' FB feeds and are not at all interesting to most members. Please post these sort of posts on the Twickenham or Richmond General FB groups.	7) Please do not post 'Thanks for adding me to the group' posts. They just clog up members' FB feeds	8) Membership. All new members must be approved by group admins. Requesters must answer the membership questions. If you invite a friend to be a member, ask them to answer the group membership questions, otherwise your request for them will be deleted after 24 hours.	9) Be kind and considerate above all else. The internet can be a challenging place and with so much stress in our lives we need a space that is warm and inviting.

PLEASE CAPTION YOUR PHOTOS WITH NAME/LOCATION/YEAR ETC....so that it is ""less ramdom"" to those who do not know you and your immediate friends :-)	Please respect that this is a specific location group and not a general memorabilia/nostalgia group, of which there are plenty on facebook.Please also understand that there are many pages and groups on facebook for sharing jokes.That is not to say that we lack a sense of humour, as much humour has been had whilst commenting on reminiscences  directly to do with Hainault.	Any racist comments, jokes, links etc will result in removal from this group page.If you have such opinions, then either keep your opinions to yourself, or leave and join the Britain First or any other Infidel pages/groups, if you have not already done so.	Thankyou everybody for taking time to read this.	We hope you enjoy your time on this group page  and still manage to get all  your jobs done :-) 	See less	Private	Only members can see who's in the group and what they post.

A google search on Kensington Market reveals virtually nothing - except for info on a market in Canada with the same name? Ken Mkt, for almost four decades, was central to new, directional and alternative fashions, lifestyles and clubbing. It provided a contact place for people living in London and visting from across the world ...... a place where people could meet, see new fashions, get info on new clubs, bands and events.

Since the group was formed it has evolved into a very friendly group, this and due to the fact that most of the relevant readily available photos have already been posted, we have decided to include off topic posts, taken including jokes, but be warned, the possibilty exists that some of these jokes may be misconstrued as offensive to certain people. Members are however, encouraged to post virtually anything, (obviously with a certain amount of common sense), in order to maintain this friendly, family atmosphere, however selling and advertising posts or comments are not allowed, nor are the live videos allowed of interviews with alleged criminals. We insist on courtesy and politeness at all times. Your Admin team comprises of [REDACTED] and myself [REDACTED]. As this is a Facebook Group, we strive to comply with its various protocols. This group is designed to enable its members to socialise with existing friends and family as well as meet new friends or even rekindle past relationships, however it is NOT a dating site. Racial, hostile, pornographic, religious or even disrespectful posts or comments will not be tolerated, neither will anything confrontational or blatantly rude. The blocking of an Admin will result in instant removal from the group.  ""Naming and Shaming"" is also not permitted. Strong swear words and inappropriate graphic posts will not be tolerated and will be removed and the member excluded from the group. Admin reserve the right to remove any post, comment, or the member responsible at their discretion and without  forewarning or explanation. Should you encounter something that you feel inappropriate or spam, please either scroll past and ignore it, or report it to an Admin to prevent the problem escalating. We cannot allow debates on political, racial or religious views, as these always result in problems. Please remember, we are all adults and we cannot cater for the over sensitive or children, which may find a way onto this group, this is soley the responsibility of the adult or parent/guardian of the child. You are advised not to display addresses or phone number on the group for your own security.

It is largely for local history items and events, but also for people who live, or have lived in the area to post their memories of things they done, places they went to and things they saw in their youth, or in the past.	MEMORIES is our keyword.	NO ADVERTISING!	GROUP POSTING GUIDELINES
	POST GUIDANCE: Please post your comments, memories and photos, relevant to living in Winchmore Hill And Palmers Green Memories or nearby areas.                                                                                                                            Your memories may come from non-local areas. This is permitted as long as the page content is mainly about our locality. Examples: WWI, WWII, Local Celebrities (resident now or previously), Films set in the area, Schools, Parks, Music, Pubs (closed or demolished), Old and Demolished Buildings, Historic Court Cases, etc. 
	Photos posted on this group with a visual copyright notice (like those from the Enfield group), must not be shared elsewhere. Any members found doing so will be blocked from the group.                                                                         This is a Private Group, so members‚Äô comments cannot be seen outside this group. Therefore they should not be copied and posted elsewhere. Any photos posted by members are on the understanding that they may be added to our photo albums, or used elsewhere within the group. You will be credited. This is is a local history page and although yesterday is history, post comments and threads that relate to the more distant, more interesting past.	Etiquette: No detrimental remarks which may degrade a race, colour, creed, religion, a person or their name and/or their family. Dead or alive. Please respect each member's right to be able to express their opinion, as long as it doesn't offend. Any verbal 'infighting' will be deleted, maybe at the cost of the whole thread, with possibly a warning of blocking issued to members involved.
	Threads: If you‚Äôre making a statement or asking a question that isn‚Äôt relevant to the thread above it, start a new thread. Comments and postings may be moved, edited or removed at Admin's discretion.	NO ADVERTISING!! Any ads will be removed and the offending member may or may not be, informed. Any advertising will result in the blocking of the member. Only charity, local non-profit making or local interest events advertising is allowed. Please inform admin to see if it meets our criteria, before posting; by using the message section.	CURRENT EVENTS: I‚Äôm sure all of our members take world and current events seriously, but please use this page as a form of escapism and keep those types of posts between you and your friends' pages...	...let's dream about the past instead!

""There was a lorry parked up in there,"" he says with wonder ""covered with people waving their arms, going crazy, "" That was it, I was hooked.""	Rave at the Cave	The actual venue was a railway arch that was in use midweek as a garage. On the first night of opening 800 people jammed through the doors and from that moment on ensured the Rave at The Cave a place in Acid House history.	One thing that you would have remembered if you ever went there was it had a flat backed lorry right in the middle of the big room and people would turn up early just to reserve their space for the night.	The Dj‚Äôs played from an office that overlooked the whole dancefloor and from the ground it appeared that there was a video screen but in reality it was just the Dj‚Äôs playing from behind the window in the office, great inexpensive effect! Rave at The Cave was a proper Acid House party and not a place for standing round. The crowd always had it big time and steam could be regularly seen bellowing out the side of the building.	As the weeks went on The Cave became a very popular place so another room was opened and now the venue could hold another 150 people. Ellis Dee & Chalk E White were the resident Dj‚Äôs at the Cave, The Ratpack from Trip City (islington) that were friends with Ellis played sets there as well as Lennie Dee from Unit 4 in Battersea who was Chalk E White‚Äôs connection, not forgetting the man that taught Ellis how to mix, The Tokin Jester.	The Rave at The Cave lasted quite a few months before it was subject to one of the Metropolitan Police‚Äôs first Acid House Raid‚Äôs codenamed ‚ÄúOperation Dica‚Äù Acid spelt backwards. The Police raid essentially finished off the Rave at the Cave as somewhere to party until the early hours but at least it went out with a bang. Ellis Dee and the boys came back to there own side of the river and put on events in the Dungeons in Lea Bridge Rd Hackney but hey, that‚Äôs a whole other story.

They worked very hard over the next few years with the boys, and in five years we had our first couple of national schoolboy champions of England.	We was at the hall for 8 years and then, moved to our present building which is called the Old Bath House in Church Street, Stratford, London, E15 where the 2012 Olympics will be held.	We have been at these premises now for 17 years, and from our very humble beginnings to our present day at the club, we have developed a very active Committee who help with the daily running of the club.	We now have three trainers for our nursery, who are Danny Lambert, Bernie Miller and Johnny Vaughn, three trainers for our juniors; Jimmy Lavey, Tommy Giles, Bradley Sponge, and we also have two seniors' trainers called Gary Steadman and Mathew Batty. Over our twenty five year period we have had, twenty five national schoolboy champions, nine N.A.B.C champions, and six, four nation's champions who have achieved two gold medals, three silver medals and one bronze medal for England.	Also we have had two junior A.B.A champions and twenty five boys picked from our club over the years to represent England at home and abroad.	Over sixty boys now attend the club, and thirty boys are out on bouts. The dedicated Committee and trainers have built the club into a very friendly and successful club and hope to produce more national champions in the future.

We want to provide advice, support, recommendations and good quality seconds. 	A few rules to keep this page running smoothly 	Selling posts- if you are selling multiple items please put them in an album to avoid clogging up the wall. Please also state where collection is or if you are willing to deliver. If these items are being listed on another site, please make that known A/E. 	Although we cannot tell you who to sell too we would appreciate that the item is offered to the first person that commented and then offered down to next should they not respond within 6hrs. (Please all check your others folder when showing interest in a post). Mark all items no longer available as SOLD.	Please leave at least 48hours between bumping your posts to allow everyone a fair chance of their listings to be seen.	Businesses 	Please don't post adds more than twice a week, although everyone is welcome to post, members do like to support local businesses so do bare this in mind when joining this page.	Ads regarding the sale of pets, cigarettes and money/pyramid schemes will not be allowed and will be removed immediately. Members that continue to ignore this will be removed.	We want this page to be somewhere people can share their views, have an opinion and sell their goods, so please all be respectful of each other. If you feel anyone is acting in an inappropriate way then please contact admin either on the page or on the advert using the report post button.	Recommendations 	If someone is requesting a recommendation for a class, tutor, tradesperson etc then please do share the details of someone you have actually used, rather than just suggesting someone as they are a friend/ family member.	We hope you all find this page helpful and who knows you may even make a friend or two!!! 	Thanks all...... Enjoy!

Thank G-d, after 5 months of absence, Home Education Group is Back, and please G-d Stronger! We don`t give up!	Every sunday, between 13:00pm and 18:00pm, in Children`s Playground in MARKFIELD PARK (Crowland road London N15 6UL Haringey). Plenty of time to enjoy parents &children. 	And Oh I forgot, we wear a CAP or a Reggae headcover, just to be recognised as Home Educators/Homeschoolers. (Also,it is practical in case it rains!) 	We all are looking forward to meet each other again and to welcome new parents in the Home Education group! xxx [REDACTED] EL	In this group everything, I really mean everything that is related to Home Education is welcome on this wall.	This includes: - Home Ed: posters, quotes, outings, questions, anecdotes you'd like to share, difficulties, joys, sites, books and toys to buy. You can even promote your own small business, books and toys. Swapping. You can fill the rest...	But please show your sense of corporate responsability by not advertising or over-posting  'free services' (which are welcomed but should not cover the page) because over-posting clogs our community page while members have to scroll for other messages, and it discourages the posting of personal messages by home-schooling parents who like everyone like to draw on a clean piece of paper so to speak. This group is for and by  those brave home-schooling  creative parents 'themselves' and ought to keep this for a priority. 	Edited membership rules 'we maintain respectful speech, please no overt or covert advertising (by adding your weblink to a post or posting something 'free' but, even if valid, for business); those who do may have their membership suspended, since otherwise it fills our page'.  So please don't wear us out, nor make us follow your online web-links to find out what your post is about concerning whether your service is really free and please be clear about that on your facebook page too. Otherwise posts are mostly not accepted and when it is an advertisement however nice, creative, inspiring admirable,  and helpful your service may (really) be, a well meant thank you for being there to help parents home-schooling, but in case of promoting online businesses etc, those who post them without mentioning that it is an online business their membership may be cancelled if it doesn't say which is which on t h i s page, since even we may become a bit weary sometimes due to having to 'find out' after searching on-line. 	After having added those membership rules, parents feel free to post again because there is an increase of postings by members with questions, suggestions, announcements, and other communication 	Home-schooling is also dealing with other parents who naturally need appreciation and information in a loving and peaceful way and may want a peaceful personal page which deals with home-schooling.  Thanks for your contribution and understanding	The group is yours! Feel free and welcome in the family!

Selling of personal goods is not allowed, there are other sites that give this opportunity. The business and services promotions are to be confined to the following posting methods:	‚Ä¢	Given the current climate we would like to support local small businesses, so every Wednesday local businesses can post their ads. This will be contained to one post; Business Wednesday and anything outside of this will be deleted.	‚Ä¢	Charity Tuesday allows any local charities to promote their services/request help within the one post.	‚Ä¢	The NHRA does not recommend any businesses or service and has no liability for any issues encountered by residents.

The club is part of the British Karate Kyokushinkai (BKK) organisation which belongs to the the International Federation of Karate and  was established in 1965. 	Training is on Tuesday & Friday 18.30- 19.30 (Juniors) and 19.30- 21.00 (Seniors).	All instructors are licensed by the BKK (British Kyokushinkai Karate) and IFK (International Federation of Karate).	What is Kyokushin Karate?	Karate is both an art and philosophy, because each person has a different personality, this reflects itself in their interpretation. Therefore, karate masters founded their own schools, teaching their style or ryu.	Kyokushinkai is the name given to our style.	KYOKU - means ultimate SHIN - truth or reality KAI - to meet, join, associate. This takes a lifetime to understand its true meaning	History of the BKK:	The British Karate Kyokushinkai now has over 45 Dojos in Great Britain and in 1978 staged the largest Karate Tournament ever to be held in Great Britain at Wembley Stadium. Kyokushinkai is now known for its high standard of Knockdown Tournament fighting which is based on full contact. However, the British Karate Kyokushinkai also competes in Kata Tournaments, Nihon Shobu Tournaments and Clicker style Tournaments (which are a Kyokushinkai innovation). The British Karate Kyokushinkai is a founding member of the International Federation of Karate and through this organisation will continue to take part in world events with like-minded Kyokushin Karateka.	The British Karate Kyokushinkai is also a founder member of the English Karate Governing Body, English Traditional Karate Body.	The Grading Syllabus is one of the worlds most comprehensive and is administered and controlled in Britain by a highly qualified Board of Examiners.	Biography of Hanshi Steven Arneil:	Hanshi (Honorable Master) Steve Arneil was born in South Africa in 1934 in a place called Krugersdorp. At the age of 10, his family moved to Northern Rhodesia now known as Zambia, where he began training in Judo and boxing. His mother stopped him from doing boxing, but he continued studying Judo.	From an early age, Hanshi was fascinated with the Orient, and he began watching a Chinese man practicing Shorin (Shaolin) Kempo in the man's back yard. The Chinese man noticed Arneil ""spying"" on him, and invited him to train. Arneil accepted the offer and trained with his new friend throughout his school years and college.	Around the age of 25, Hanshi moved back to Durban, South Africa, to complete his education in mechanical engineering. He found a local Judo dojo in Durban that also offered karate. At the time, a number of Japanese people were emigrating to South Africa, arriving at the port city of Durban. Arneil would go to the arriving ships and ask if any of the Japanese practiced karate. If so, he would invite them to train at the dojo. These men practiced various karate styles, but Arneil didn't care about the differences ‚Äì to him, karate was karate.	After completing his engineering education, Hanshi went back home to Northern Rhodesia. Still fascinated with the Orient, he decided to go there and experience it for himself, and his Chinese friend gave him the names of people to train with in China. Fresh out of college and without any money, he got a job as an engineer on a ship and worked his way from Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), to Kowloon, Hong Kong. From there, he went into China and traveled northward to the province of Manchuria, where he came to a monastery at which he studied Shorin (Shaolin) Kempo. The rigorous training, strict discipline, daily work in the monastery's fields and daily meditation was just what Arneil was looking for ‚Äì he was in ""seventh heaven.""	Unfortunately, China was began to experience the Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, and life for a Westerner in China began to get difficult. People outside of the monastery even started hitting Arneil on the head with their copies of Mao's ""Little Red Book"". His friends at the monastery suggested that he leave China for his own safety, and they brought him back to Kowloon to train with another kempo teacher. The training was very different from the monastery, and Hanshi didn't like it.	Around that time, Hanshi heard of a karate master in Japan named Mas Oyama, and he was determined to go there and seek him out. He didn't have enough money to get to Japan, so he first had to work on boats to the Philippines. In 1961, when Hanshi finally saved enough money, he returned to Hong Kong and from there went to Yokohama, Japan.	Initially, Hanshi felt lost in Japan ‚Äì he couldn't speak the language and knew nothing about Japanse culture other than the name of its capital. He somehow managed to get to Tokyo and found his way to the Kodokan, the headquarters of one of Japan's styles of Judo. Hanshi trained at the Kodokan for a short while and received the rank of Shodan (1st Dan) in Judo, but he was really interested in studying karate.	At first, Hanshi studied Goju Ryu karate under Gogen Yamaguchi. (Yamaguchi, who lived from 1909 to 1989, was also the instructor of So Nei Chu, under whom Mas Oyama trained in the late 1940's.) He trained in Shotokan karate as well, but still felt that something was missing.	Shortly after earning his Shodan in Judo, Hanshi met an American named Don Draeger and asked him if he knew of this karate master who ""knocks bulls out."" Draeger did, and he took Arneil to Mas Oyama's dojo. Hanshi saw the intensity of the training and the discipline of the students, and he knew that this was where he wanted to be. Draeger (who was fluent in Japanese), asked the instructor if Hanshi could train there. The instructor told him that if he were interested, he would have to sit and watch, since Mas Oyama was in America at the time.	For about six weeks, Hanshi sat and watched, until one day Mas Oyama returned. Using Draeger as a translator, Mas Oyama told Hanshi that he needed to come back and watch for a few more weeks in order to really make up his mind about joining the dojo. And so he waited and watched some more. After two weeks, Mas Oyama gave Hanshi his first karate gi (uniform) and said that he would have to start from the beginning.	He trained very hard, and even though he wasn't Japanese, he was treated the same as the other kohai (juniors). They started training at 6:00 PM and couldn't finish until Mas Oyama was finished, usually four or five hours later. Along with the other kohai, Hanshi had to wash the dirty karate uniforms for the entire school and clean the dojo and its toilets ‚Äì including emptying the toilet buckets.	When Hanshi tested for the rank of Shodan in Kyokushin Karate, he learned an important lesson in life from Mas Oyama. At the test, he thought that he did better than the others, but when the promotion list came out, his name wasn't on it. No one told him why, and he became very upset and stayed away from the dojo for a few days. Finally, Mas Oyama came by and asked Hanshi where he had been, and he responded that he had been sick. Hanshi was depressed and wanted to leave Japan, but he didn't have enough money to do so. Instead, he stuck it out and continued to train. At the next promotion test, Hanshi lacked some confidence in himself, but he did what he had to do. When the promotion list came out, he was finally on it as a Shodan.	Looking back on what happened, Hanshi later realized that he wasn't ready in his mind or heart when he first tested. If he had earned his Shodan the first time, he would have left Japan and moved on to something else, thinking that he had learned enough. Mas Oyama later told him that he saw more in Hanshi than just a black belt, and he took the chance of losing his student through disappointment. Hanshi‚Äôs initial failure eventually let him develop the patience, determination and perseverance (Osu) needed to master Kyokushin Karate.	Over the next few years, Hanshi Arneil intensified his training efforts and progressed rapidly. During this time, Mas Oyama became like a father to him. In fact, Mas Oyama actually adopted him so that he could marry a Japanese woman. With the financial support of his wife, who worked in a bank, Arneil was able to stay in Japan and train. To earn money, he also acted in some movies under the name ""Steve Mansion"".	One day, Mas Oyama told Hanshi that he wanted him to perform the 100 man kumite (fight). Others had tried to do it, but no one (other than Mas Oyama) was able to complete all 100 fights. At first, Hanshi thought that Mas Oyama was crazy for asking him, since he didn't think he could do it. Mas Oyama kept pestering him until he finally agreed, and after which he trained fanatically for the event ‚Äì 18 hours a day, every day, doing kata, makiwara (punching post) training and bag work. Hanshi asked when he would do the fights, and Mas Oyama said that he would let him know when he was ready. Hanshi kept on training, thinking that Mas Oyama had only done this in order to get him to train harder. One Sunday morning, he went to the dojo to train. When he walked in, everyone was there waiting for him.. This was the day.	The fights commenced and at first, Hanshi tried to keep track of how many fights he had completed, but stopped doing so after the first 20 in order to concentrate on fighting. He completed all 100 fights in about 2 hours and 45 minutes ""You can save time if you knock them out"", Hanshi said.	Before leaving Japan in 1965, Hanshi had achieved the rank of Sandan (3rd Dan). He moved to Great Britain and began to teach Kyokushin Karate there. That same year, he and Shihan Bob Boulton founded the British Karate Kyokushinkai (BKK) organization. Between 1968 and 1976, Hanshi was the team manager and coach for the All Styles English and British Karate team, which became the first non-Japanese team to win the World Karate Championship in 1975-76. In 1975, the French Karate Federation also awarded him the title of the ""World's Best Coach.""	In 1991, Hanshi and the BKK resigned from the International Karate Organization (IKO), and he founded the International Federation of Karate (IFK). The IFK currently has a membership of over 120,000 in 19 countries. After the death of Mas Oyama in 1994 and the subsequent splintering of the IKO, Hanshi was asked by Mas Oyama's widow to lead the IKO. Not wishing to become involved in the tangled politics of the various Japanese organizations, he politely declined the offer, in order to devote his time and efforts toward running the IFK and teaching Kyokushin Karate.	One of Hanshi's goals in the IFK is consistency ‚Äì every Kyokushin karateka in any country at any dojo should perform the techniques and katas the same. Toward that end, he has developed a systematic grading syllabus for the IFK and has published a book on Kyokushin kata. Mas Oyama had told him that the only way you can unify an organization is by doing the same thing, and the only way you can do the same thing is by kata.	Mas Oyama, prior to his death, personally awarded Hanshi Arneil with the rank of Shichidan (7th Dan). The entire British karate community later awarded him with the rank of Hachidan (8th Dan) for his dedication and services to karate in Great Britain. On May 26, 2001, the Board of Country Representatives of the IFK awarded Hanshi Arneil with the rank of Kudan (9th Dan) in recognition of his work in promoting Kyokushin Karate throughout the world during the past 40 years, and in particular during the past 10 years under the banner of the IFK.	While studying Kyokushin Karate in the early 1960's, Hanshi took meticulous notes of what Mas Oyama taught him. and because of this, for the past four decades he has taught Kyokushin Karate true to the spirit of Sosai Mas Oyama. Despite his busy schedule as head of the IFK, Hanshi still teaches Kyokushin Karate ‚Äì to beginners as well as black belts ‚Äì on a regular basis.

The society benefits from the help and support of the Royal Parks and the management at The Hub.	We converge upon The Hub one evening each month in the beautiful Regent's Park for a free and informal meeting of like-minded people ranging from the curious novice to the expert. While we always bring telescopes to the meetings we encourage anyone who has their own optical equipment to bring that along too.	Unlike most Astronomical Societies, we do not require membership or charge a fee for joining. Everyone is free to come along to our meetings, find out why we do what we do and ask for advice. We aren‚Äôt going to let a little light pollution stop us from bringing astronomy to central London, where millions of potential stargazers go about their lives unaware of the stunning natural beauty hanging above their heads, just beyond the sky.	The number of people attending has steadily grown and we are now as much of a social gathering as one for astronomy. Our core aim is to bring the wonders of astronomy to new people of all ages and levels of interest and astronomical knowledge.	Don‚Äôt forget to tell your friends, family and work colleagues about the Baker Street Irregular Astronomers and join us at one of our monthly meetings.

	Chislehurst Caves are a labyrinth of dark mysterious passageways which have been hewn by hand from the chalk, deep beneath Chislehurst. There are over 20 miles of caverns and passageways, dug over a period of 8000 years. The vast complex of caves are a maze of ancient mines originally carved out in the search for flint and chalk. They are divided into three main sections, Saxon, Druid and Roman. Each section was later connected by digging joining passages.
	The presence of chalk has been important to civilisations over thousands of years, and still is to date. Mining chalk provides Lime and Flint.
	Lime is the basic for plaster and whitewash paint, flint was used for manufacturing tools by early man and later for building. The mining activity is difficult to date however the mines appear on a charter circa 1250 and also in local church records of 1737.
	The last time the mines were known to have been worked was around the 1830's when the Saxon section was used by a flintmaker and limeburner. 
	The local railway made the mines more accessable in 1865, and this aided its formation as a tourist attraction. The caves also became the setting for several underground concerts in the early 1900's. During the 1914 World War the mines became part of Woolwich Arsenal, used as an ammunitions depot. A narrow gauge railway was installed to aid the transport through the passages. Up until the outbreak of the Second World War the mines were used by the Kent Mushroom Company. 
	The war and the constant bombings over London turned the caves into a massive air raid shelter within easy reach from London and its main suburbs. 
	The caves again became a major tourist attraction early this century. 
	The Caves are also used as a film location and have been used by the BBC and independent film companies. Doctor Who, Insemenoid, Bliss, Neverwhere and Randall & Hopkirk (deceased) have all been filmed at the caves. 
	The Caves are open from Wednesday to Sunday and the 45 minute guided tours start hourly. The first tour is at 10am and the last at 4pm. 
	During local school and Bank Holidays (except Christmas and New Year) we are open every day.

Health professionals can promote their services by posting on the group on SATURDAYS ONLY (not by individual messages to members). 	The idea is to get to understand each other rather than sell to each other. Referrals can then be made for people who are genuinely suitable for your service.

This group's purpose is to answer queries, encourage discussion and spread awareness of the various elements in the case. We also discuss the people involved and topics that skirt at the periphery.	It's controversial, warped, conflicting, contradicting - but never dull.	Rules:	1. Don't block admins. We can't do our jobs properly if you do.	2. Debate is fine; abuse is not. Don't abuse other members.	3. Don't delete threads without permission from an admin. We need them up as evidence of wrongdoing.	4. Don't post personal contact information on the threads, i.e. phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. Save it for private messaging. Exception: members involved in research projects.	5. Follow Facebook's Community Standards.	Violating these rules may lead to expulsion from the group. 	Tips:	- How do you engage in debate without making it too personal? Focus on the person's statement, not them. Instead of calling someone a liar, for instance, illustrate, through proof, that their statement is factually inaccurate. The statement, itself, in that context, can be called a lie. 	That does not mean the person isn't a liar, but it's a ""safe"" way of avoiding going down the personal attack path.	- Logical fallacies are the bane of effective debate.

We are run as a non-profit organisation who's aim is to develop, organise and promote BMX racing in the Hillingdon Borough and surrounding area.	We currently operate from the Lake Farm BMX Track at Lake Farm Country Park, Dawley Road, Hayes. The track is public, free, and open for use at all times except during club events. Beginners are encouraged to come along to one of our organised events, where we can provide limited club bikes and safety gear, together with expert guidance to get you started. We are affiliated to British Cycling, who are the governing body for racing in the UK and form part of the Southern BMX Region.	The Hawks regularly host local and Regional races at our home track, and many of our members also represent the club at National and International level. There is usually a large contingent of Hawks riders at most of the big races and we also organise fund-raising and social events throughout the year. We hold regular coaching sessions during the school holidays, and one night a week during the summer months.	Club Sessions: Easter - September,  Weds 6-9pm  and Sat 11-1 . (Weather Permitting)	Winter- Oct - March. Every Sat 11.00am-1.00pm. (Weather Permitting)	We currently have a membership of over 120 riders, a committee of 12 to manage the club and an army of parents, supporters and volunteers who help to keep the club successful.	Future plans for the track (subject to funding) include a full rebuild to National standard, the construction of a dirt jump area for various abilities, and a concrete skatepark, in partnership with Hillingdon Council, is now in the final stages. The overall plan is to combine all of the bmx disciplines within our venue.	We have successfully ran free bmx coaching sessions during the school holidays for the last two years and also purchased BMX Bikes and safety gear thanks to funding from the following groups, Community Cohesion & Local Childrens Network Fund. 	We are always looking for new riders to join our club, both young novices and oldschoolers making a return! and if it's your kids that want to do the racing we always welcome the help of parents at our events.

Slough Swifts hosted the World's in 86 and the Euro's in 91, two of the biggest events to be held in this country to this day. Also the first Club to have a hydraulic gate with lights in this country and it still worked to the day we took it out and replaced it.	The first event the Hawks ran on the Slough track was the 96 British Champs and the following years the Club hosted Nationals each year and a second British Champs right up to their last major event @ Slough for the National over the Queens 50th Jubilee weekend in 2002...

Located on the isles of Tinhar√© in the Atlantic Ocean, Morro de S√£o Paulo‚Äôs tropical paradise island as a two hour boat ride from Salvador, Bahia. Intimately close to the cultural capital of Brazil but worlds apart, the children of Tinhar√© live in an unspoilt natural environment whose hopes for a bright future are diminished by the few jobs available in the hotels, restaurants and nightclubs. Incentives to study are low, as is access to a good education and with a short high tourist season bringing in insufficient funds to ride the economic drain the rest of the year, a rife drug problem plagues the idyllic island community.	Founded by Marcos Santana in December 2005, TRIBO Tinhar√© set up a place for the 30 ‚Äì 50 children (4 to 19yrs) of the island to use computer facilities and instruments as well as attending workshops and performances and offers both an alternative and an incentive to elevate the children‚Äôs chances of success. Developing musical, performance and social skills, the children and young adults build self-esteem as out-standing members contributing positively to their community. TRIBO Tinhar√© is offered to the children for free and the project is sustained from funds raised from the Main Triboband and workshops in Europe.	Additionally, members from TRIBO London and TRIBO Zurich visit the island every year and an exchange programme is projected for the future.	Brasilianische Lebensfreude pur	Mit ihren fr√∂hlichen und mitreissenden afro-brasilianischen Rhythmen ist TRIBO ein Mix aus purer Lebensfreude und Sonnenschein‚ÄìVibes und ein echtes Live-Erlebnis, bei dem die Seele Brasiliens sp√ºrbar ist und die Freude und Begeisterung direkt aufs Publikum √ºbertragen wird.	TRIBO hat ihre Wurzeln im Nordosten von Brasilien in der Stadt Salvador da Bahia, was in ihrer Musik, basierend auf Samba-Reggae Rhythmen, sowie in der traditionellen Kleidung zum Ausdruck kommt.	Aus Liebe zur afro-brasilianischen Perkussion und motiviert durch den Wunsch, die Musik seiner Heimat in die Welt hinauszutragen, hat Gr√ºnder und musikalischer Leiter Marcos Santana, fr√ºheres Mitglied von Timbalada, TRIBO im M√§rz 2008 in London ins Leben gerufen und vereint die talentierten MusikerInnen aus Bahia und London zu einer gl√§nzenden multikulturellen Besetzung.	Ihre Musik kombiniert er immer wieder neu, wobei er Samba-Reggae Rhythmen mit Elementen aus Latin Rock, Funk und kubanischer Musik vermischt und so den fr√∂hlichen Karneval-Sound neu kreiert, der sofort zum Tanzen anregt und nun dank TRIBO das ganze Jahr hindurch genossen werden kann. Dabei bildet die groovige Perkussion, gespielt von typischen Instrumenten Surdo, Timbal, Bacurinha, Pandeiro, Ganzar, Congas und Cowbell, die Grundlage und wird von Keyboard, Gitarre und energievolle 	See less",Public,TRUE,2008,2008-09,2008-09-03T00:00:00Z,"London, United Kingdom",General,2022-09-26,474,2,0,1	Be kind and courteous	2	No hate speech or bullying	3	No promotions or spam	4	Respect everyone's privacy,0.004,small,low,4.21940928270042,low,0_london,0_london,0,london

The Roding rises near Dunmore in Essex and flows down the Roding Valley to join the Thames near Barking.
